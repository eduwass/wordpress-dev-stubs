> Hello everyone! This is Viktor who runs the php-stubs organization. I am planning to stop contributing to the WordPress ecosystem because it is extremely difficult and I do not earn (min) â‚¬100/month.

Please support my work to avoid abandoning this package.

This package provides stub declarations for the [WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)
functions, classes and interfaces.
These stubs can help plugin and theme developers leverage IDE completion
and static analysis tools like [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

The stubs are generated directly from the [source](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce)
using [php-stubs/generator](https://github.com/php-stubs/generator).

## Requirements

- PHP >=7.1

## Installation

Require this package as a development dependency with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```bash
composer require --dev php-stubs/woocommerce-stubs
```

Alternatively you may download `woocommerce-stubs.php` directly.

## Usage in PHPStan

Include stubs in PHPStan configuration file.

```yaml
parameters:
    bootstrapFiles:
        - vendor/php-stubs/woocommerce-stubs/woocommerce-stubs.php
        #- vendor/php-stubs/woocommerce-stubs/woocommerce-packages-stubs.php
```
